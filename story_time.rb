Heres the story of a lovely lady
Who was bringing up three very lovely girls.
All of them had hair of gold, like their mother,
The youngest one in curls.

Its the story
Of a man named Brady
Who was busy with three boys of his own
They were four men
Living all together
Yet they were all alone

Til the one day when the lady met this fellow
And they knew that it was much more than a hunch
That this group must somehow form a family
Thats the way we all became the Brady bunch
